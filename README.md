#Python Skeleton
As I am constantly loosing time building and configuring some boilerplate for my
 various tests, I decided to store a repository with any variations.
 
For now available branches include :

- <b>master</b>: 
  - python3 alpine docker file and docker-compose project file
  - behave library for BDD and its configuration file behave.ini
  - makefile for an easier management
  
If you want to use it be sure to update any variables in the .env configuration
 file to your needs.
